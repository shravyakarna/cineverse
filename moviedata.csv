But The Kid still, like all of Chaplins films, is a very sad one. Theres still barely enough to eat, authorities still antagonize only the proletarian classes, the "proper care and attention" of an orphanage only causes social disruption. Even as charming as the window breaking sequence is, the Tramp and the Kid have to resort to illegal work in order to make enough money to afford to eat. The Welfare Officer refuses to even speak to the Tramp, and speaks to him through a surrogate, in the Tramps own home.

But they are consistently moving, provocative & especially heartbreaking. And if we subtract this movies brilliant coda - this is one of the most heartbreaking movies ever made. One can sense that Chaplin is not a person who understood sarcasm. The Tramp is a dot in the world, almost imperceptible, and saddest of all thinks so much better of the world than it actually is. He has no conception of the casual cruelty of other humans. He dreams, makes plans, all based on an inkling of a hope thats based on a joke anyways. And maybe its these same kind of dreams that which…|Absolutely beautiful. One of the most perfect works of the cinema, in which the desire for gold, the lurch for success, even the hopes and dreams of the future of the average citizen is merely the sometimes (if not often) misguided redirection of the desire just to be loved, appreciated, recognized, accepted. The yearning in this film is unparalleled.

I shouldn’t have been surprised at its ground breaking visual magnificence, as it was after Lang’s stunning Metropolis, but dolly, crane, and single long shot techniques that I had thought were pioneered much later by the likes of Wells and Hitchcock were demonstrated here in an effortless way that didn’t scream look at me!, but rather enhanced the viewer’s sense of unease and moved the story along smartly.

Class consciousness is something rarely seen in the media, but its important that were aware of it. As the film shows, fighting inequality is not about ideology (being a red) but about acknowledging an obvious injustice. John Ford, despite his conservative associations, did make films about unions (see also How Green Was My Valley) and he creates a poetic melancholy in The Grapes of Wrath through the tale of poverty and desperation. His technique is, as always, well considered and his use of shadows and silhouettes creates anonymity amongst the suffering.Its difficult to approach a classic like The Grapes of…|There were no grapes, and no wrath, but there was communism.|“Grapes of Wrath” is a shadow of the American odyssey. As directed by John Ford, the lumbering, towering automobile of the Joad family makes its way across the frontier looking like a wagon train rattling along the Oregon Trail. Where the wagons would leave tin and furniture at the crossings of vast rivers and steep mountains, Ford films piles of discarded sundries on the outskirts of migrant camps in Southern California. As captured by cinematography great Gregg Toland, “Grapes” was, as Ford put it, “a beautifully photographed movie with nothing beautiful in it to shoot.” Toland and Ford switch effortlessly between tones in the film. The Hoovervilles have the sharp edges and claustrophobia of German expressionism. The unending plains and…

Ernst Lubitsch is pissed off but entirely confident in his storytelling, never relenting from harsh realities but still sly enough to make a smile and a tear one and the same.

His view remains simple, clear and unabated but at the same time encloses the many different nuances and variables at play, without diluting and overshadowing its fundamental principles.Based on the Judges Trials that took place in Nuremberg in 1947 right after World War II as part of a series of military tribunals against followers of the Nazi regime, Abby Manns screenplay is a magnificent showcase of the power and importance…|"The most important film I had never even heard of before."There was a fever over the land.

Each act is a discrete and self-contained plot with its own beginning, middle, and end, which make High and Low more of a crime anthology than an epic. Still, all the main characters appear (physically or vocally) in all three stories, tying them together and leaving room for an epilogue which unites the circuitous narrative.

This isnt a new idea to me, but this film more or less crystalized what I hate about them. In short, gangsters are not Robin Hood. They do not rob from the rich to give to the poor. They do not empower the poor; they feed off of them. They do not fight injustice disguised as law; they simply treat the law as coincidental. The closest argument you have is that they gave immigrant populations recourse to power in a system that hated them, and that is certainly true. But you rarely see them wield that power toward anything but assimilating into the system in a backward sort of way. While some gangster films have…

Ran|1985|160|4.50 out of 5|Drama, History, Action|Japanese|Akira Kurosawa|Tatsuya Nakadai, Akira Terao, Jinpachi Nezu, Daisuke Ryū, Mieko Harada|With Ran, legendary director Akira Kurosawa reimagines Shakespeares King Lear as a singular historical epic set in sixteenth-century Japan. Majestic in scope, the film is Kurosawas late-life masterpiece, a profound examination of the folly of war and the crumbling of one family under the weight of betrayal, greed, and the insatiable thirst for power.|https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/c4/m5/4p/a2/ran-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000.jpg?v=30dbcbd34b|I feel like I just witnessed color in film for the first time. There is a lot to love about Ran. Its way of finding heart and beauty in a story fueled by hatred and tension is one of my favorite aspects, I suppose. But then theres the color. And the editing. And everything else. Im just really glad this wasnt my first Kurosawa and that Ive unintentionally been building my way up to this. Because while it does stand alone as a fantastic piece of filmmaking, theres something really special when putting this in the context of his other work. Ran puts every skill Kurosawa has mastered throughout his career to the test. As a result you get what is easily his best work and an experience that is so good, to call it overwhelming would be an understatement.|  learned a lot about proper weapon usage from this one!guns? for cowards horses? for tramplingfire? for castle-burningswords? for vengeancearrows? for bundling together to teach your chaotic sons a metaphor about unitydaggers? for non-lethally slicing your brother-in-law’s neck then licking his blood while demanding he marries you|Chaos.Yet, there is hardly anything chaotic about Ran. A certain degree of harmony is always present, regardless of what is depicted on screen, be it war, manipulation, betrayal, or masssacre. A field trampled over by horses yet undisturbed, soldiers marched and chanted in an orderly fashion, a battlefield filmed in silence. Even the fire and smoke seemed geometrically symmetrical.  Everything just looks so... calculated. Organized. Every prop, down to each speck of dust, is exactly where Kurosawa wanted them to be. The position of the actors, where theyd look, where theyd put their hands, even the mountains at the background, the flowers, the clouds, are all adjusted to fit each frame perfectly. Kurosawa had full control over his film, like a painter would have over his painting. Now, that is something.

Describing watching a film as an experience often detracts from the quality of the piece, but going by the profound effect the film had on me I really feel no other word can do it justice.World War 2 films often seem to fall victim to Hollywood romanticism and sensationalism and while that certainly has some appeal, I always prefer my war films on the grimmer side. Grim and bleak is something the Russians do really well and combined with the atrocities that occurred during WW2 in Belarus, what we are presented with is one of the most disturbing and confrontational studies of the devastating effects of war…

Trademark scenes drenched in darkness and emotions conveyed via actions. From the moment Will hits the bottle again till the end is some of the most impeccable, timeless storytelling that I’ve ever seen.Monolithic.One of my all timers.

Thats all it is. Its used to keep warm, a shelter against the blistering cold. Gusts of wind tatter and billow, threatening the gentle glow that results from the little red coat. In all the horror, the absolute Hell, the devastation, the inhumanity; a simple color evokes so much more than the thought of gentle compliments and a tender smile. Steven Spielbergs Schindlers List is simply one of the greatest films committed to celluloid. Bar none. No exaggeration. It is as essential, historical, vibrant, emotional, magnificent, harrowing, and impeccably orchestrated as anything thats ever been released in the cinematic medium. And like the red coat of the little girl, the film will never fade, only growing in distinct majesty and singular clarity.|As iconic, almost mythic of a filmmaker Steven Spielberg is, this is the sort of film you would never imagine he has in him. Masterpiece in every sense of the word.|Probably the greatest movie I never want to see again.

The last 15 minutes were a pure adrenaline rush. That courtroom scene was riveting. My blood was boiling.This movie delivers a hammering rock soundtrack by Hendrix, Dylan, Bono and Gavin Friday, setting a high-speed pace as fast as we can absorb to match the scene’s ambiance: we breathe rapidly, our adrenaline begins to surge, and our emotions go on a rollercoaster. It’s highly worth a watch in the name of the father of Gerry Conlon.

Thats all Forrest does in the whole movie, and he ends up a famous millionaire entrepreneur war hero athlete and pop culture icon. Jenny, on the other hand, does the exact opposite, questions the status-quo at every turn, stands up for what she believes in all throughout the movie...and ends up a depressed abuse victim with two broken homes and AIDS.Subtle. Yeah,…|"  when he finally saw forrest jr. and he was like "is he smart?" i was like oh great now i gotta get up and get the tissues to wipe these ugly tears away"|This is like, some kind of weird, conservative fantasy. If watching this served any good purpose, its a possibly vital reminder that the Clinton era was not as progressive as many of us might like to remember - the latter half of the 20th century in America through the eyes of a reactionary, nearly 50 years of social tumult regarded as just a brief phase of unrest before everything returns to normal, - the Vietnam War, Black Panthers, and social justice activists regarded as a big joke, Jennys character is subtly demonised - every decision she makes is the wrong one, she doesnt find happiness until she bends to Forrests will - Forrest is always right - even though he does nothing but observe.

After all, he killed Hitler.|A masterwork of breathtaking realism & historical accuracy, Downfall (Der Untergang) recreates the events surrounding the final days of German dictator Adolf Hitler in the Führerbunker while also depicting the fall of the Third Reich & Berlin during World War II. The film is bookended by excerpts from the real-life Traudl Junge, Hitlers final secretary, and the plot itself is derived from her accounts.The best thing about this film is that it keeps the human traits of the Führer intact and boldly defies the conventional portrayal of Hitler in media which was controversial as expected but in my opinion is a brave, admirable & important attempt. What makes it bold is that by taking this approach, the picture reminds the viewers that…|Pretty heavy stuff for morning viewing!I cant stress this enough... it is an exceptionally well crafted film about Hitlers last days!

Catalysed by the existing conflict from the Rwandan Civil War, and exacerbated by a prepared political elite known as akazu; what resulted was an eruption of terror and intense violence that snatched the lives of an estimated one million Rwandan souls in the period of around one hundred days.This key historical drama is based on real life events that transpired only twenty years ago – a modern day holocaust that…

This is about a husband and fathers real betrayal.

It distracts from the now."

You will laugh, and you will shed tears, while watching this. The protagonist also looks a lot like Freddie Mercury. The grandpa is a unique character. He, at first, seems like a giant jerk, but then reveals himself to be a character with a lot of heart, as the story progresses. There are some flaws with this. First, the beginning of this film takes place in the 1980 coup, but is hardly mentioned beyond that. We dont see how the coup affects Turkish society, or how the United States possibly had a hand in it. The dead wife isnt also mentioned past the beginning. The acting is hammy as well. Theres this one scene thats supposed to be a tearjerker, but is made unintentionally hilarious by the grandpas overacting. I feel like a bad person for laughing at that scene.

Nobody does grizzly, chewed up and bitter, better then Eastwood.This is my second time of watching Gran Torino and it wasnt as shocking as the first time…|  This movie is awful, but I must say it succeeds in one regard: being a textbook example of the “white savior” narrative. Clint Eastwood literally throws his arms out in a crucifix-pose at one point, it’s unbelievable.I got some enjoyment out of watching a crotchety old Eastwood, and the film was competently shot, so I feel wrong plummeting the rating too low. But man, this has so many problems beyond being uber-racist (despite its constant attempts to convince you otherwise). A lot of the acting here is The Room level bad. And the narrative is 60% awkward filler. It was almost surreal watching some of these scenes knowing that this movie is pretty well-received.EDIT (9/28/2021): Damn I had no idea there was so much activity on this review.

Through this Eastwood achieves his most sustained masterclass in economy. Were only given tiny glimpses into Walts past: the silver star, lines like "I killed a lot of men," or "what haunts a man isnt what hes told to do, its what he does without being asked" (something like that, Ill…"

I like to think it would be roundly rejected and would inspire frequent think pieces that were also full of recommendations of what you should watch instead.But then I remember Green Book won best picture and that this film’s overt popularity is because it gives the people what they want. It gives them the stereotype of Blackness they expect and parades it for their amusement while also promoting a world in which ‘we can all get along’. A world underpinned by harmful stereotypes and damaging dynamics, and consistent othering.Here is an illustrative thing that happens…

Pixar has just stolen my heart and opened a door to another world in a way that showcases the limitless possibilities of cinema. Pete Docters Inside Out is a masterpiece.

For my money, the best Pixar’s ever been, the thesis of all their work, and a perfect example of what fantasy can be: not just a hero’s journey, but a stunning, expansive metaphor.

Don’t think I’ve seen this since the theater release, and both times I found that beginning sequence far more emotional than anything else.
